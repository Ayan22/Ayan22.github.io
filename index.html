  Ayan was here.  He likes Teslas.   I thinks and knows Teslas are the best. I quote him "I liked to thank the academy for this wonderful opportunity.  I   have learned so much.  Without your support, I wouldn't be here today."  He was born yestereday and eats apples.  He likes everything relating to apples including the brand.  He is awesome. His friends include Avi and Varun.
