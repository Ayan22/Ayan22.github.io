  <p>The world is dying.  We constanly kill our beautiful Earth by
  emitting green house emmisions and constanly increasing our carbon
  footprint.  One of the major emitters that are used daily are cars.
  In the last 10 years, there has been a huge push to try and make
  electric cars which have 0 tailpipe emmisions.  However, most of
  these cars have either little range, were slow, or were way to
  expensive.  Tesla, a company built by the amazing Elon Musk solves
  all of these issues. Here you will learn about Teslas, aswell is
  recieve up to date information about this outstanding company. You
  can also see my frieds Avi and Varun, who are both Tesla lovers.</p>
